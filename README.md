- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ryan, a software engineering student at Heriot Watt University.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in video games, reading, painting 40k models... pretty much anything geeky you can think about I probably enjoy.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning web development, I'm starting with the basics of frontend and trying to get a good understanding of HTML and CSS before moving on.
